\maketitle

{\large\textbf{Memory Allocation Algorithm}}\\\\
[Provides a thorough description of ALL prescribed memory allocation schemes - 6 marks]
[Provides an informed discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of these schemes]
For each: pros, cons, examples
First Fit
Worst Fit
Next Fit
Best Fit
[Justification of choice - identifies memory allocation algorithm used in code and clearly justifies choice in context of assignment - 2 marks]
Buddy System (UNIX uses a version of this)

a. Describe and discuss what memory allocation algorithms you could have used
and justify your final design choice

{\large\textbf{Queuing, Dispatching, Memory Allocation, and Resource Allocation
Structures}}\\\\
[Provides thorough description of ALL dispatcher structures that are relevant to host dispatcher implementation - 5 marks + 1 bonus]

b. Describe and discuss the structures used by the dispatcher for queuing,
dispatching and allocating memory and other resources.

{\large\textbf{Program Structure}}\\\\
[12 marks + 3 bonus]
[Provides comprehsnsive description of overall program structure, its modules, and major functions]
[Provides detailed and clear justification of program structure in context of assignment]

c. Describe and discuss the overall structure of your program, describing the
various modules and major functions (description of the function interfaces are
expected)

{\large\textbf{Discussion - Use of Multilevel Dispatching Scheme}}\\\\
[20 marks + 5 bonus]
[Demonstrates extensive knowledge and understanding of operating systems concepts relevant to the question]
[Provides an insightful discussion of the reasons why multilevel dispatching schemes are important for process management]
[Provides an insightful comparison of the HOSTD dispatcher and other multilevel dispatching schemes used in at LEAST TWO different real operating systems]
[Outlines a range of shortcomings of the HOST dispatcher and possible improvements to address them with clear details justification]
[Refers to well-chosen examples to inform response]
[Presents a sustained, cohesive and logical response using appropriate information and ideas from a range of sources]

d. Discuss why such a multilevel dispatching scheme would be used, comparing
it with schemes used by `real` operating systems. Outline shortcomings in such a
scheme, suggesting possible improvements. Include the memory and resource
allocation schemes in your discussion
