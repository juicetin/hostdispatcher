\maketitle

{\large\textbf{Memory Allocation Algorithm}}\\\\
a. Describe and discuss what memory allocation algorithms you could have used
and justify your final design choice

{\large\textbf{Queuing, Dispatching, Memory Allocation, and Resource Allocation
Structures}}\\\\
b. Describe and discuss the structures used by the dispatcher for queuing,
dispatching and allocating memory and other resources.

{\large\textbf{Program Structure}}\\\\
c. Describe and discuss the overall structure of your program, describing the
various modules and major functions (description of the function interfaces are
expected)

{\large\textbf{Discussion - Use of Multilevel Dispatching Scheme}}\\\\
d. Discuss why such a multilevel dispatching scheme would be used, comparing
it with schemes used by 'real' operating systems. Outline shortcomings in such a
scheme, suggesting possible improvements. Include the memory and resource
allocation schemes in your discussion
